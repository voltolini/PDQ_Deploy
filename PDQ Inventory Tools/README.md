Here is the Tools Section. One of the most interesting part.
````
I need to explain some Tools like 'Change AD Description' (Computer's Description), 
or 'Allow Public Desktop's access' (Here, users can't touch desktop items so I allow 
them manually), or 'Kill not responding' (Process not responding, a right-click on 
Desktop only) [...] I'll write everything here with code, but it's a big part ahah (12/07/2019).
````
````
You just need to import this .xml file into the PDQ Inventory console to access this list of tools.
You need to adapt/translate some parts. 
When imported in PDQ, you can modify and test each Tool in shell mode (Powershell or CMD).
You choose to capture output or not, leave shell open or not.
