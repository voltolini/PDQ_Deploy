PDQ_Repo  (Not Official)

````
Repository about PDQ Deploy/Inventory Tools, Utilities, Scripts ...
To Check, Repair, Change ...
This Repo is the root of PDQ Deploy's Repository.
These are my daily Tools to manage 2500 Workstations, under Windows 7.

For the moment, i'll add .xml files and tools/scripts, one after another.
Sorry if you want to add everything at once, will see later.
Some parts have been translated into French.

I hope this will serve others.
For others Installations Packages.. Most of the time, this concerns dedicated applications, 
or requires the Enterprise version to manipulate...Hard to share this.
Can still be usefull for Free Version users ):

For most of "Check*" packages (include CheckSound, but surprise inside), it export an html (or csv) report, 
you need to open the report.. Most of checks come from http://www.nirsoft.net .
I usually put this Package on a Directory in PDQ with the report's path in title.
I just select this second package, Ctrl+C, Windows+R and Ctrl+V, to open it, see Screenshot below.
I just need to automatically open the report once generated. I have not yet figured out how to do that.

PS:
The qualities of a good IT Tech ?
1 - RTFM !
2 - Never believe the end user. Don't trust, verify.
3 - If you work well, you'll spend time at the coffee machine with the secretaries. I said it, I'm lazy.
